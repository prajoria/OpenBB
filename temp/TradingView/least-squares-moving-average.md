#### Summary

The Least Squares Moving Average can be used as a trend indicator and reversal indicator. It is used as an alternative to other traditional indicators like the moving average or exponential moving average. The Least Squares Moving Average has a different calculation than both of those moving averages. The indicator displays a linear regression based on the prices for a specific period of time. This period of time can be defined in the indicator settings.
