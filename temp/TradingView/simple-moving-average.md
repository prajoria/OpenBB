#### Definition

[Moving Average (MA)](<https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/movingaverage/>) is a price based, lagging (or reactive) indicator that displays the average price of a security over a set period of time. A Moving Average is a good way to gauge momentum as well as to confirm trends, and define areas of support and resistance. Essentially, Moving Averages smooth out the “noise” when trying to interpret charts. Noise is made up of fluctuations of both price and volume. Because a Moving Average is a lagging indicator and reacts to events that have already happened, it is not used as a predictive indicator but rather an interpretive one, used for confirmations and analysis.

Simple Moving Average is an unweighted Moving Average. This means that each day in the data set has equal importance and is weighted equally. As each new day ends, the oldest data point is dropped and the newest one is added to the beginning.

It must be taken into account that, while SMA helps filter out the noise and see the general direction in which the symbol has been moving, it is also slow to react to newer changes. The higher the SMA length is, the longer it will take for a major price change to be notably reflected in it.

#### CALCULATION

A Simple Moving Average with the length of X is a sum of last X values divided by X. Here is an example calculation of an SMA with the length of 3:
[code]
    Sum of Period Values / Number of Periods  
      
    Closing Prices to be used: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
      
    First Day of 3 Period SMA: (5 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 6  
    Second Day of 3 Period SMA: (6 + 7 + 8) / 3 = 7  
    Third Day of 3 Period SMA: (7 + 8 + 9) /3 = 8
[/code]
