### Cashflow Statement Growth

Measure the growth rate of a company’s cash flow with the FMP Cashflow Statement Growth API. Determine how quickly a company’s cash flow is increasing or decreasing over time.

The FMP Cashflow Statement Growth API provides key insights into the cash flow growth rate of a company, an essential metric for assessing a company's financial health. This API is crucial for: Financial Performance Evaluation: Analyze the rate at which a company&rsquo;s cash flow is growing. A positive growth rate indicates that the company is generating more cash than it is using, which can signal strong financial health and operational efficiency. Investment Decision-Making: Use cash flow growth data to identify companies with strong cash flow generation capabilities. Companies with consistent positive cash flow growth are often more stable and may represent good investment opportunities. Risk Assessment: A negative cash flow growth rate can be a red flag, indicating that a company is using more cash than it is generating. This information can be used to evaluate the risk associated with investing in or continuing to hold a company&rsquo;s stock. Example Investor Analysis: An investor might use the Cashflow Growth API to assess a manufacturing company&rsquo;s financial health by examining its cash flow growth over the past five years. If the company shows consistent positive growth, the investor may decide to increase their investment in the company.

# TechnicalIndicators

## Technical Indicators

### Simple Moving Average

Arithmetic mean of an asset's closing prices over a fixed look-back window, smoothing short-term noise to expose the underlying trend.

The SMA is computed as the unweighted average of the last N closes for the requested timeframe. Traders use it to identify trend direction, define dynamic support and resistance, and generate crossover signals against price or against a second SMA of different length. Because every observation carries equal weight, the SMA reacts more slowly than weighted variants such as EMA or WMA.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/sma?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

**Parameters**

| Query Parameter | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| symbol* | string | AAPL |
| periodLength* | number | 10 |
| timeframe* | string | 1min,5min,15min,30min,1hour,4hour,1day |
| from | date | 2026-03-01 |
| to | date | 2026-06-01 |

**Example Response**

    "close": 307.34,
    "volume": 65310502,
    "sma": 310.291
  }
]
```

---

### Exponential Moving Average

Moving average that applies exponentially decaying weights to past prices, making the line more responsive to recent moves than a simple SMA.

The EMA gives the most recent close the highest weight and decays older observations geometrically with smoothing factor 2 / (N + 1). It reacts to new information faster than the SMA, which makes it preferred for shorter-term crossover systems and momentum strategies, at the cost of being more sensitive to whipsaws in choppy markets.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/ema?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

**Parameters**

| Query Parameter | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |

| periodLength* | number | 10 |
| timeframe* | string | 1min,5min,15min,30min,1hour,4hour,1day |
| from | date | 2026-03-01 |

**Example Response**

```json

    "volume": 65310502,
    "ema": 308.44057474678436
  }
]
```

---

### Weighted Moving Average

Moving average that assigns linearly decreasing weights to older prices, balancing the responsiveness of an EMA with a deterministic decay.

In a length-N WMA the most recent close is multiplied by N, the previous by N-1, and so on, with the sum divided by N(N+1)/2. The linear decay puts more emphasis on recent data than the SMA while remaining simpler and more predictable than the EMA, making the WMA useful when a clear, bounded weighting profile is desired.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/wma?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

**Parameters**

| Query Parameter | Type | Example |

  }
]
```

---

### Double Exponential Moving Average

A faster, lag-reduced moving average defined as 2·EMA − EMA(EMA), designed to track price more closely than a standard EMA.

DEMA subtracts the EMA of an EMA from twice the EMA itself, which cancels much of the lag inherent to single-pass exponential smoothing. The result is a curve that hugs price during strong trends and turns earlier at reversals, which traders pair with EMA crossovers, MACD-style histograms, or trend filters for breakout systems.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/dema?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

**Parameters**

| Query Parameter | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| symbol* | string | AAPL |
| periodLength* | number | 10 |
| timeframe* | string | 1min,5min,15min,30min,1hour,4hour,1day |
| from | date | 2026-03-01 |

    "close": 307.34,
    "volume": 65310502,
    "dema": 312.41959432990143
  }
]
```

---

### Triple Exponential Moving Average

A further lag-reduced moving average defined as 3·EMA − 3·EMA(EMA) + EMA(EMA(EMA)), tighter to price than both EMA and DEMA.

TEMA layers three EMAs in a way that cancels more lag than DEMA while preserving most of the smoothing benefits of an exponential filter. It is favoured by short-term trend followers who want fast trend confirmation, though its sharper turns also make it more prone to whipsaws in low-volatility regimes.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/tema?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

**Parameters**

| Query Parameter | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |

| periodLength* | number | 10 |
| timeframe* | string | 1min,5min,15min,30min,1hour,4hour,1day |

### Relative Strength Index

Momentum oscillator bounded between 0 and 100 that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to flag overbought and oversold conditions.

RSI is computed from the average gains and losses over the chosen period, with classic thresholds of 70 (overbought) and 30 (oversold). Beyond extreme readings, traders watch for divergences against price, mid-line crossings around 50 as a trend filter, and shifts in the index's own range to confirm regime changes.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/rsi?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

**Parameters**

| Query Parameter | Type | Example |

    "rsi": 56.87420287286961
  }
]
```

---

### Standard Deviation

Rolling measure of price dispersion around its mean over a fixed window, used as a fundamental gauge of volatility for the requested asset and timeframe.

The endpoint computes the standard deviation of closing prices over the supplied period length, sampled at the chosen timeframe. It underpins volatility-based tools such as Bollinger Bands, position-sizing models, and risk filters, and is often used directly to detect volatility regime shifts or to normalise other indicators.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/standarddeviation?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

**Parameters**

| Query Parameter | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |

### Williams

Momentum oscillator bounded between -100 and 0 that locates the current close relative to the highest high and lowest low of the look-back window.

Williams %R reads -20 or above as overbought and -80 or below as oversold, mirroring the structure of the Stochastic but using only highs and lows. It is well suited for identifying short-term exhaustion in trending markets, especially when combined with a longer-term trend filter to avoid taking countertrend signals.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/williams?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

**Parameters**

| Query Parameter | Type | Example |

  }
]
```

### Average Directional Index

Indicator measuring trend strength on a 0–100 scale, derived from smoothed directional movement and used to separate trending markets from ranging ones.

ADX is the smoothed average of the absolute difference between the +DI and -DI directional indicators over the chosen period. Readings above 25 typically signal a developing trend and above 40 a strong one, while sustained values below 20 suggest a range-bound market. The indicator describes strength only — direction is read from the +DI / -DI pair.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/technical-indicators/adx?symbol=AAPL&periodLength=10&timeframe=1day`

## TipRanks Search

### Analyst Ratings Search

Full TipRanks analyst ratings search. Returns each individual analyst rating sourced from TipRanks, including the specific recommendation and price target from a given analyst, the action taken, the originating article/source, the price target currency (converted by default, native when nonadjusted=true), and the analyst's identity (name, firm, expertUID). Filterable by symbol, expertUID and recommendation date range, ordered newest first.

The TipRanks Analyst Ratings Search API provides a chronological feed of every analyst recommendation sourced from TipRanks, making it the primary search interface across the full ratings history. This endpoint offers: Analyst Identity: Each result names the analyst, their firm and a stable expertUID you can pass to the point-in-time endpoints. Recommendation & Action: The rating itself (Buy / Hold / Sell) alongside the action taken — for example an initiation, upgrade, downgrade or maintained call. Price Targets: Converted into a common currency by default, or returned in their native currency when nonadjusted=true is supplied. Article Attribution: A headline, source site and link back to the originating article so each call can be traced to its publication. Flexible Filters: Narrow by symbol, focus on a single analyst with expertUID, or bound a window with from and to; pagination is controlled via limit (max 5000) and page. Results are ordered newest first, so the endpoint is well suited to powering activity feeds, analyst-driven research dashboards and historical backfills for a watchlist.

> **Note:** Ratings history only goes back 3 years. For analyst ratings older than 3 years, contact support — historical backfill requires an Enterprise plan.

## TipRanks PIT Latest

### Point in time Ratings by Symbol

Point-in-time summary of a symbol's analyst ratings as of a chosen date. Queries all ratings on the ticker from that date and prior, collapsing the history to each analyst's latest active call (one row per expertUID) and surfacing per-analyst statistics — analystRank, stockSuccessRate and stockAvgReturn — alongside the price target. Price targets are FX-converted by default (nonadjusted=true for native currency).

The TipRanks Point in time Ratings by Symbol API answers a focused question: as of a given date, what did every analyst covering this ticker have on the books? Instead of streaming every historical rating, it collapses the history so each analyst appears once with their most recent active call. This endpoint offers: Coverage Panel: One row per analyst with the latest recommendation, the price target attached to that call, and the article that triggered it. Analyst Quality: Each row includes the analyst's overall analystRank, historical stockSuccessRate and stockAvgReturn for the ticker, so consumers can weight credibility inline. Historical Snapshots: An optional date parameter rolls the snapshot backwards, letting you reconstruct what the consensus looked like at any prior point in time. Currency Control: Price targets are FX-converted by default; pass nonadjusted=true to receive native-currency values. Pagination: Standard limit (default 100, max 5000) and page parameters for large coverage universes. The compact, one-row-per-analyst shape makes this endpoint a natural fit for stock-page coverage panels and current-consensus widgets.

> **Note:** Ratings history only goes back 3 years. For historical analyst ratings beyond that window, contact support — it requires an Enterprise plan.

**Endpoint:** `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/tipranks-pit-symbol?symbol=AAPL`

### Point in time Ratings by Analyst

Point-in-time summary of a single analyst's ratings as of a chosen date. Queries all of the analyst's ratings from that date and prior, returning one row per symbol they cover with their latest active call, the attached price target, and per-row statistics (analystRank, stockSuccessRate, stockAvgReturn). Targets are FX-converted by default (nonadjusted=true for native currency).

The TipRanks Point In Time Ratings by Analyst API inverts the symbol-centric view: instead of asking who covers a stock, it asks what a single analyst's active book looks like. Supply an expertUID and the response returns one entry per ticker the analyst covers, each carrying their most recent recommendation as of the chosen date. This endpoint offers: Analyst Book: A portfolio-style view of every name the analyst currently covers, with their last call collapsed to a single row per symbol. Price Targets & Articles: The latest published target on each ticker along with the article and source site that triggered the rating. Performance Context: analystRank, stockSuccessRate and stockAvgReturn travel with every row, ready to render alongside the call. Historical Reconstructions: A date parameter rewinds the snapshot, so you can see what an analyst's book looked like at any past point. Currency & Pagination: nonadjusted=true returns native-currency targets, while limit (max 5000) and page handle large coverage lists. The endpoint is purpose-built for analyst profile pages and any view that needs to surface an analyst's open positions at a glance.

> **Note:** Ratings history only goes back 3 years. For historical analyst ratings beyond that window, contact support — it requires an Enterprise plan.

## TipRanks Summary

### Ratings Summary by Symbol

Aggregated rollup of all TipRanks ratings on a single ticker over a date window. Returns one row with totalRecommendations plus distinctAnalysts covering the name, a recommendation breakdown (buy/hold/sell) and analyst-action breakdown (initiated/maintained/upgraded/downgraded/reiterated/resumed). Also includes price-target accuracy stats: validPriceTargets and comparedPriceTargets counts, beats vs misses, and return metrics (averageReturn, topReturn, worstReturn). Window defaults to the trailing twelve months.

The TipRanks Ratings Summary by Symbol API rolls up every Tipranks rating on a single ticker into a single summary record over the chosen window. Rather than returning each rating individually, it tallies how the Street has been positioning on the name. This endpoint offers: Consensus Breakdown: Counts of each distinct recommendation (Buy, Hold, Sell) issued on the ticker during the window. Action Mix: Counts of each kind of analyst action — for example initiations, upgrades, downgrades and reiterations — so volume and tone can be inspected together. Total Activity: A totalRecommendations counter that summarises how much research the ticker attracted in the period. Configurable Window: from and to bound the recommendation date range; the default window is the trailing twelve months. The endpoint returns a single compact row, which makes it ideal for consensus chips, headline widgets and screener-scale fan-outs across a watchlist.

### Ratings Summary by Analyst

Aggregated rollup of every recommendation a single analyst (expertUID) has issued over a date window. Returns one row with totalRecommendations plus distinctSymbols covered, a recommendation breakdown (buy/hold/sell) and analyst-action breakdown (initiated/maintained/upgraded/downgraded/reiterated/resumed). Also includes the analyst's price-target track record: validPriceTargets and comparedPriceTargets counts, beats vs misses, and return metrics (averageReturn, topReturn, worstReturn). Window defaults to the trailing twelve months.

The TipRanks Ratings Summary by Analyst API characterises a single analyst's posture over a chosen window by tallying every recommendation they have issued. This endpoint offers: Recommendation Mix: A count of each distinct rating (Buy, Hold, Sell) the analyst has published in the window, exposing how bullish or bearish their book has been. Action Profile: A breakdown of analyst actions — initiations, maintenances, upgrades, downgrades and so on — capturing how often the analyst is changing their view. Activity Volume: A totalRecommendations counter that quantifies coverage activity over the window. Configurable Window: expertUID selects the analyst, while optional from and to parameters bound the date range (defaulting to the trailing twelve months). The compact, single-row response is well suited to analyst profile metrics, side-by-side comparison tables and research-quality scoring.

### Ratings Summary by Firm

Aggregated rollup of all ratings issued by analysts at a given firm over a date window. Pools the whole desk into one row with totalRecommendations plus distinctAnalysts and distinctSymbols, a recommendation breakdown (buy/hold/sell) and analyst-action breakdown (initiated/maintained/upgraded/downgraded/reiterated/resumed). Also includes desk-wide price-target accuracy: validPriceTargets and comparedPriceTargets counts, beats vs misses, and return metrics (averageReturn, topReturn, worstReturn). firmName must match the data exactly (e.g. 'Morgan Stanley'). Window defaults to the trailing twelve months.

The TipRanks Ratings Summary by Firm API aggregates TipRanks activity at the firm level, pooling every analyst at a given firm into a single summary of what the desk has been publishing. This endpoint offers: Desk-Wide Consensus: A count of each distinct recommendation (Buy, Hold, Sell) issued by the firm's analysts in the window. Action Footprint: A breakdown of the kinds of actions the desk has taken — initiations, upgrades, downgrades, reiterations and the rest. Coverage Volume: A totalRecommendations counter that captures how active the firm has been over the period. Configurable Window: firmName selects the firm (matched exactly as it appears in the data, e.g. Morgan Stanley); from and to bound the window (defaulting to the trailing twelve months). The single-row response is purpose-built for firm-comparison views and for surfacing a sell-side desk's footprint on a research page without enumerating every individual report.

## Tipranks Analysts

### Analyst Directory Lookup

Analyst directory lookup by name. Resolves a TipRanks analyst profile, returning the stable expertUID used by the other TipRanks endpoints, the analyst's firm and profile image, star rating (numOfStars), and aggregate performance metrics (successRate, excessReturn, totalRecommendations, goodRecommendations). No fuzzy matching — analystName must be passed exactly as published.

The TipRanks Analyst Directory Lookup API is the canonical resolver for Tipranks analyst profiles. Given an analyst's name it returns the full profile record needed to render an analyst page or to bridge into the rating and summary endpoints. This endpoint offers: Stable Identifier: The expertUID that other Tipranks endpoints expect as input. Biographical Block: The analyst's firm and profile picture URL, ready to power a profile header. Star Rating: The numOfStars rating Tipranks assigns based on track record. Performance Metrics: Aggregate quality statistics including overall successRate, average excessReturn, plus totalRecommendations and goodRecommendations counters. Provide the analyst's name in analystName exactly as it is published (for example Andrew Marok); the endpoint does not perform fuzzy matching, so callers should reuse names as returned by the search or point-in-time endpoints.
